        <p id="text">In 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old boy walked in and
            asked for a job. Labor
            laws were loose back then and the boy managed to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.

            Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned tricks from the older employees.
            He
            experimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was
            not
            performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on becoming a comedian.

            Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were
            small and his
            act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too
            busy drinking
            or talking with friends to pay attention. One night, he literally delivered his stand-up routine to an empty
            club.

            It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better. His first routines would only last
            one or two
            minutes. By high school, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a few years later, a
            ten-minute
            show. At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems during
            the show
            just to make the routine long enough, but his skills continued to progress.

            He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He took a job as a television writer and,
            gradually,
            he was able to land his own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being a
            regular
            guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.</p>
